1. Merge Sort - Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

2. DFS_Graph - Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures
             - Create a recursive function that takes the index of the node and a visited array.
             - Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
             - Traverse all the adjacent and unmarked nodes and call the recursive function with the index of the adjacent node
